# FAQ

## Why does `npm init agent-badge@latest` mention `create-agent-badge`?

Because npm initializers are published as `create-*` packages. `npm init agent-badge@latest` resolves to `create-agent-badge`, which is a thin initializer entrypoint that runs `agent-badge init` for the current repo.

## What do I do once per machine and what do I do per repo?

Install the shared runtime once per machine:

```bash
npm install -g @legotin/agent-badge@latest
```

Then, in each repo you want to badge, run:

```bash
npm init agent-badge@latest
```

If GitHub auth is missing, repo setup still completes and live publishing is deferred until you rerun `agent-badge init` after auth is ready.

## What if I only use Codex or only use Claude?

That is supported. `agent-badge` scans whichever provider directories exist on the current machine. If one provider is missing, the CLI reports partial coverage instead of inventing data.

## Does install fail if GitHub auth is missing?

No. Local setup still completes. Live gist publishing is deferred until auth is available.

## Why did init say `Shared runtime: unavailable`?

That means the shared CLI is not currently callable from your shell `PATH`, or the installed binary is broken. Install or upgrade `@legotin/agent-badge` globally, run `hash -r`, verify `agent-badge --version`, then rerun `agent-badge init` or `agent-badge doctor`.

## What gets uploaded?

Aggregate badge payloads and shared metadata only. No prompt text, transcript text, filenames, or local paths are published.

## Can I use pnpm, yarn, or bun?

Yes for the runtime. Use npm for the one-step initializer, or install `@legotin/agent-badge` directly and use that package manager's exec form. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## What if neither provider directory exists?

The CLI can still install itself, but the badge will not reflect meaningful usage until at least one supported provider directory exists on that machine. Use `AGENT_BADGE_CODEX_DIR` or `AGENT_BADGE_CLAUDE_DIR` when the data is stored outside the default locations.

## Where is the single source of truth for commands and flags?

Use [CLI.md](CLI.md). It covers every command exposed by the current CLI surface.

## How do I move an existing badge to a new machine?

Reconnect the existing public gist with:

```bash
agent-badge init --gist-id <id>
```

For shared-publish continuity and migration edge cases, use [MANUAL-GIST.md](MANUAL-GIST.md) and [RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md).

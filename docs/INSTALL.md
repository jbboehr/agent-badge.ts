# Install

`agent-badge` is npm-initializer-first. The default path is a shared runtime with minimal repo artifacts, and explicit package installation stays available as an alternative.

If your requirement is "works on the first try without debugging", use only the sequence under **First-Shot Recommended Path**. The one-line initializer path is best-effort and can defer publish or report shared runtime repair guidance.

## Setup Model

There are only two setup actions to remember:

- Once per machine: install the shared runtime so `agent-badge` is callable on `PATH`.
- In each repo: run `npm init agent-badge@latest` to write local agent-badge data (under `.agent-badge/*` by default), the managed `.gitignore` entries, the `pre-push` hook, and the README badge wiring.
- Before live publishing: make GitHub auth available in the shell. That is machine or shell state, not repo-owned setup.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Supported | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | `20.x`, `22.x`, `24.x` | The runtime and initializer are tested in CI on these release lines. |
| Git repository | required | `agent-badge init` expects to run inside a repo. |
| Local provider data | `~/.codex` and/or `~/.claude` by default | Override with `AGENT_BADGE_CODEX_DIR` and `AGENT_BADGE_CLAUDE_DIR` when provider data lives elsewhere. |
| GitHub auth | optional for local setup, required for live publish | Without auth, init finishes locally and defers gist publishing. |
| Public GitHub Gist | required for live publish | The stable badge URL is backed by a public gist you own. |

If neither configured provider directory exists, install still succeeds, but the badge will not report meaningful usage until provider data appears.

## First-Shot Recommended Path

If you want setup to succeed in one pass without runtime-resolution surprises, run this sequence in order:

```bash
# 1) Install shared runtime once on this machine
npm install -g @legotin/agent-badge@latest

# 2) Refresh shell command cache and verify runtime is callable
hash -r
agent-badge --version

# 3) Ensure gist-capable auth is available in this shell
gh auth status
gh auth token >/dev/null

# 4) Initialize the current repo
npm init agent-badge@latest

# 5) Confirm wiring and publish readiness
agent-badge doctor
agent-badge status
```

Expected `init` ending for a fully ready first shot:

```text
- Publish target: created public gist
- Setup: complete. Shared runtime, pre-push refresh, and live badge publishing are ready.
```

## Fastest Path

If you already understand the setup model and want the short version, use:

Once on this machine:

```bash
npm install -g @legotin/agent-badge@latest
```

In each repo:

```bash
npm init agent-badge@latest
```

This path keeps the quick instructions short. It skips the explicit validation and diagnostic steps from **First-Shot Recommended Path**.

That initializer:

- creates `.agent-badge/config.json` and `.agent-badge/state.json`
- updates `.gitignore` for state, cache, and logs
- wires a failure-soft `pre-push` refresh hook
- inserts the badge into `README.md` once a stable badge URL is available
- does not install repo-local `@legotin/agent-badge`, managed `agent-badge:init` / `agent-badge:refresh` scripts, or repo-local `node_modules` by default

If GitHub auth is already available in the shell, init can create and publish the gist on the same run. If auth is not available yet, local repo setup still completes and publish is deferred until you rerun `agent-badge init` after auth is ready.

When GitHub auth is available and the shared runtime is already on `PATH`, init can finish with:

```text
- Publish target: created public gist
- Setup: complete. Shared runtime, pre-push refresh, and live badge publishing are ready.
```

If GitHub auth is not available yet, init finishes with:

```text
- Publish target: deferred
- Badge setup deferred: set GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN, or GITHUB_PAT to create a public gist automatically, or rerun `agent-badge init --gist-id <id>` to connect an existing public gist.
- Setup: repo setup complete, but GitHub auth is still required before the live badge can publish. Set GH_TOKEN, GITHUB_TOKEN, or GITHUB_PAT, then rerun `agent-badge init` or connect a public gist with `agent-badge init --gist-id <id>`.
```

If the shared runtime is not on `PATH` yet (for example, init reports `Shared runtime: unavailable`), install it once globally or user-scoped, run `hash -r`, verify `agent-badge --version`, then rerun `agent-badge init` or `agent-badge doctor`.

## Alternative: Direct Runtime Install

If you do not want the initializer, install `@legotin/agent-badge` directly and run `init` yourself.

| Package manager | Install | Run the CLI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm | `npm install -D @legotin/agent-badge` | `npx --no-install agent-badge init` |
| pnpm | `pnpm add -D @legotin/agent-badge` | `pnpm exec agent-badge init` |
| yarn | `yarn add -D @legotin/agent-badge` | `yarn agent-badge init` |
| bun | `bun add -d @legotin/agent-badge` | `bunx --bun agent-badge init` |

The managed `pre-push` hook uses the shared command contract directly:

```bash
agent-badge refresh --hook pre-push --hook-policy fail-soft || true
```

## Package Names

The npm package names are intentionally split:

- `npm init agent-badge@latest` resolves to `create-agent-badge`
- `@legotin/agent-badge` is the shared runtime CLI package when you want an explicit install path
- `@legotin/agent-badge-core` is the published internal library used by the runtime

That split is normal npm initializer behavior. You should expect `create-agent-badge` in `npm init` logs. You should only expect `@legotin/agent-badge` in repo dependencies when you choose the direct install path.

## After Install

Check the current state:

```bash
agent-badge status
```

If publish was deferred, follow [Authentication](AUTH.md) and rerun:

```bash
agent-badge init
```

If you want the full command reference next, use [CLI.md](CLI.md).
